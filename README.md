(This is intended for a certain rhythm game you may or may not know about.)

So this is the source code for the FNF tool.

# How to build

Step 1. Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org), if you haven't already. You will also need it for other aspects of FNF modding.
Step 2. Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com). Don't forget the UI and ADDONS packages!
Step 3. Run the tool. Simply open a command line for the the folder (not just source, it has to also cover the Project.xml), then type in the following command.

If you are on Windows: 
 - `lime test windows`

Mac: 
 - `lime test mac`

Linux: 
 - `lime test linux`

Make sure to not close the window immediately after compiling, as you need access to it in the command line to see your coordinates.

Alternatively, you can use - `lime test html5` to run it on your browser, however I don't recommend this.

Happy modding!
